In this repository, you'll find pre-trained YOLOv8 models trained to identify a wide range of different objects and solve different problem. This repository includes models ranging in size from YOLOv8n to YOLOv8x.

Where a dataset used in a model is available publicly, a link is added to the data in the `Dataset Page` links provided below. Live demonstrations and deployment options for the models are available at the provided `demo page` links.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

Have you built a YOLOv8 model that you want to add to the list above? Great! To contribute, submit a PR to the README.md file in this repository that adds your project to the bottom of the `Model Zoo` section. Links to both the demo and dataset pages are optional, although you must submit either a demo or a dataset for your project to be added to the list.
